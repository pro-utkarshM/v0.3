## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 20
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs)

### Initial Setup

To get started with the College Ecosystem on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nerdynet/nerdynet.git
cd nerdynet
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn install
# or
npm install
# or
pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile --prod=false

```

This command installs dependencies for all projects defined in the apps directory.

#### For individual projects

```bash
npm install --workspace=platform
```

#### Specific package

```bash
npm install some-package --workspace=platform
```

## Usage

### Running Projects/Apps (app/\*)

To run individual projects locally:

```bash
yarn workspace [app-name] run dev
# or
npm run --workspace=[app-name] dev
# or
turbo dev --filter=[app-name]
# e.g.
turbo dev --filter=platform

```

### Building Projects/Apps (app/\*)

To build individual projects for production:

#### Platform

```bash
yarn workspace [app-name] run build
# or
npm run --workspace=[app-name] build
# or
turbo build --filter=[app-name]
# e.g.
turbo build --filter=platform


```

### Running Turbo Commands

To utilize Turbo Repo for optimized workflows:

```bash
yarn turbo run [command]
# or
npx turbo run [command]
# or
turbo [command]
```

Replace [command] with `build`, `dev`, `lint`, or `test` as needed.

## Scripts

The root `package.json` file defines scripts for common tasks:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "turbo run dev",
    "build": "turbo run build",
    "lint": "turbo run lint",
    "test": "turbo run test",
    "format": "prettier --write \"**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,md}\""
  }
}
```
