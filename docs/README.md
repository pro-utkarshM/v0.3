- You need to estimate project completion time
- You want to see high-priority features

### Cleanup Summary (CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md)
Documentation of the major codebase cleanup where irrelevant features (classroom management, hostel system, etc.) were removed.

**Use this when:**
- You need to understand why certain features were removed
- You're reviewing the project's evolution
- You want to know what the codebase used to contain

### Feature Analysis (IRRELEVANT_FEATURES_ANALYSIS.md)

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you're new to the project, read the documents in this order:

1. **[Project Status](./PROJECT_STATUS.md)** - Understand what's built
2. **[Implementation Summary](./IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)** - Learn the technical details
3. **[What's Left](./WHATS_LEFT.md)** - See what's coming next

## 🔄 Keeping Documentation Updated

Documentation should be updated when:

- ✅ A new feature is completed
- ✅ A major refactoring occurs
- ✅ The project roadmap changes
- ✅ Features are added or removed

## 📝 Contributing to Documentation

When adding or updating documentation:

1. Use clear, concise language
2. Include code examples where relevant
3. Update the index (this file) if adding new docs
4. Follow the existing format and structure
5. Commit documentation changes with code changes

## 🎯 Documentation Standards

### File Naming
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for major docs
- Use descriptive names (e.g., `FEATURE_ANALYSIS.md` not `DOC1.md`)
- Include dates in version-specific docs

### Content Structure
- Start with a clear title and description
- Use headings to organize content
- Include a table of contents for long documents
- Add code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Use emojis sparingly for visual organization

### Markdown Style
- Use `**bold**` for emphasis
- Use `code blocks` for technical terms
- Use tables for structured data
- Use lists for sequential information
- Use blockquotes for important notes
